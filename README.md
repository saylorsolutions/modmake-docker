# Modmake Docker Plugin

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker)

This repo provides some base functionality for building, running, and interacting with Docker images and containers.
If you're not familiar with [Go](https://go.dev/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or [Modmake](https://saylorsolutions.github.io/modmake/), then this probably isn't for you yet.
Check out those first and circle back here to find out how this can help you.

## API Docs

The API docs are generously hosted here:
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker

## How to get it

Just like Modmake itself, this plugin can be added to your project as a dependency. 

> The Docker CLI is required to be available on the PATH to use this plugin.

```bash
go get github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker@latest
```

Once that's done, this can be incorporated into any new or existing Modmake build.

## Reporting Bugs or Recommendations

If you find a bug in this project or have an idea for improvement, please [report an issue](https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker/issues/new/choose) so I can get it fixed/added.

# Basic Usage

Building images and running containers are the most basic operations, and both are supported by this plugin.

Here's a step-by-step guide for basic usage.
There are many ways this can be customized to fit your needs.

### Build Example

Given a working tree like this.
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ my-app
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â””â”€â”€ modmake
    â””â”€â”€ build.go
```

And an existing modmake build file in `./modmake/build.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	. "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake"
)

func main() {
	b := NewBuild()

	b.Test().Does(Go().TestAll())
	b.Build().Does(Go().Build("./cmd/my-app"))

	b.Execute()
}
```

We can add a Dockerfile to the root of the project like this, allowing us to run our Go executable in a Docker container.

> This isn't an example of the *best* way to run Go applications in container, but it works for a simple example.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.22

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
# Run the Modmake 'build' step
RUN go run ./modmake build

ENTRYPOINT ./my-app
```

Next, we need to update our Modmake build to include the step to build our image.

```diff
 
 import (
 	. "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake"
+	. "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker"
 )
 
 func main() {
 	b := NewBuild()
 
+	// Make sure dependencies are present in container.
+	b.Generate().Does(Go().ModTidy())
 	b.Test().Does(Go().TestAll())
 	b.Build().Does(Go().Build("./cmd/my-app"))
 
+	pkgDocker := NewStep("package-docker", "Packages a docker image ot test-project").
+		Does(Docker().Build("test-project:latest", ""))
+	b.AddStep(pkgDocker)
+
 	b.Execute()
 }
```

A call to `go mod tidy` was added with the default `generate` step to make sure the required dependencies are available for `my-app` during image build.

Once this is done, we can run the new `package-docker` step to build our Docker image with this command.
```bash
go run ./modmake package-docker
```

### Run Example

Working off of the build example, we can add another step to run the built image.
A dependency is expressed on the `package-docker` step to make sure it's always using the latest version of the image.

```diff
 		Does(Docker().Build("test-project:latest", ""))
 	b.AddStep(pkgDocker)
 
+	runDocker := NewStep("run-docker", "Runs the Docker container built from package-docker").
+		Does(Docker().Run("test-project:latest").RemoveAfterExit()).
+		// Make this depend on 'run-docker'
+		DependsOn(pkgDocker)
+	b.AddStep(runDocker)
+
 	b.Execute()
 }
```

We can run the new step with this command.

```bash
go run ./modmake run-docker
```

We'll see the image build output too since there's a dependency on the `package-docker` step.

### Composable Sub-Build

There's a lot more that can be done with this foundation, including much more interesting configuration options for both `Docker().Build` and `Docker().Run`.

One big improvement over the previous examples would be to add Docker steps to their own sub-build.
This provides an easy demarcation point for what are Docker-specific steps, and what are the base steps of the build.
The Modmake build script below will create the sub-build and import it into the parent build under the `docker` heading.

```golang
package main

import (
 	. "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake"
	. "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake-docker"
)

func main() {
	// It's good practice to add variables that make the build easily configurable.
	var (
		// Uses Modmake's PathString for portable paths.
		// All Modmake PathStrings expect forward slashes regardless of OS.
		appPath = Path("./cmd/my-app")
		// Uses Modmake's F strings for environment variable interpolation.
		// This will default to 'test-project:local' if 'IMAGE_TAG' is empty/undefined.
		imageName = F("test-project:${IMAGE_TAG:local}")
	)

	b := NewBuild()

	b.Test().Does(Go().TestAll())
	// Build the application
	b.Build().Does(Go().Build(appPath))

	// Create a Docker sub-build.
	docker := NewBuild()
	// Do 'go mod tidy' to ensure dependencies are available during image build.
	docker.Generate().Does(Go().ModTidy())
	// Build the image using the default 'build' step.
	docker.Build().Does(Docker().Build(imageName, ""))
	// Run the image after building it with a custom step.
	docker.NewStep("run", "Runs my-app in container").
		Does(Docker().Run(imageName).RemoveAfterExit()).
		DependsOn(docker.Step("build"))
	// Import the sub-build into the base build with the prefix 'docker:'.
	b.Import("docker", docker)
	// Make sure that tests pass before building the image.
	// This also means that tests must pass before running 'docker:run'
	b.Step("docker:build").DependsOn("test")

	b.Execute()
}
```

This provides a neater reference pattern for Docker steps.
Here's a table mapping the previous step name to the new step using the `docker` sub-build.

| Previous Step | Becomes |
| :-- | :-- |
| `package-docker` | `docker:build` |
| `run-docker` | `docker:run` |

## Summary

There's a lot that Modmake and this plugin can do.
Consider using it in your own builds, and let me know how it works out. ðŸ˜Š
